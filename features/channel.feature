  In order to add a scope relation to the channel
  As a administrator
  I must be able to set a relation between a channel and a scope

    And I am on "/admin/channel/"
    Then I should see "Id"
    And I should see "Name"

    And I should see "Created"

  Scenario: Add channel
    Given I am authenticated as "admin"
    And I am on "/admin/channel/new"
